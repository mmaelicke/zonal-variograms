    title: Clip netCDF by Vectors
    description: |
      Clip a RASTER netCDF file by a vector source. The resulting clips will have the same structure as the input netCDF file.
      The output netCDF will be clipped along 2D coordinates, which are detected as a combination of (lon, lat), 
      (longitude, latitude) or (x, y). The netCDF may also have a CRS definition as attribute in a 1D coordinate variable,
      which does then index all data variables (ie. by CF convention). RASTER can also be supplied in other raster formats,
      such as GeoTIFF. Other formats are not recommended.
      For the SEGMENTS vector data source it is recommended to use a geopackage. Other formats are supported as well.
      If the source holds more than one layer, the clipping will be performed for each layer individually.
    parameters:
      overlap:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: Set this to True, if the SEGMENTS may overlap. Will be significantly slower.
      crs:
        type: integer
        optional: true
        description: This will force-overwirte the CRS of the input netCDF. This is especially useful, when it cannot be read automatically.
      oid_column:
        type: string
        optional: true
        description: | 
          The name of the column in SEGMENTS that uniquely identifies the features. It is recommended to use an integer field.
          If not supplied, the rownumber will be used. 
          Note that the output files will be named after the OIDs.
      use_oid:
        type: integer
        array: true
        optional: true
        description: | 
          A list of OIDs that should exclusively be used for clipping. This does only work, if the OID column in SEGMENTS
          is of type integer. If not supplied, all features will be used.
